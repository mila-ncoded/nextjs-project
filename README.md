This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Next.js Learning App

Welcome to my first Next.js App! This project is designed to help learn Next.js, a powerful React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone ttps://github.com/mila-ncoded/react-next-projects.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-next-projects
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
